# Parcel data generation from google sheets

These queries generate RDF for the parcels involved in the project. 

The source are these gsheets: [BDG Plots](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1945ZW7cusemulYEb4w9eHDGDpdPGIS0K_-MXJs6s-Ag/edit#gid=176283442)

See [Vocabulary/README.md](../Vocabulary/README.md) for details of the process. 
Resulting RDF is in the [rdf](./rdf) folder.
