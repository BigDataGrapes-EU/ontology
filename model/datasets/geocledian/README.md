# Geoclidian data model notes

We make a separate dataset and data structure definition for each observed variable. 

They folllow the same pattern except for NDRE, where we reuse the same variables but code the variant (NDRE1, 2 or 3) using the `bdg:ndreVariant` attribute 

The provided DSDs account for this particularity.
